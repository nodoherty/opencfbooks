opencfbooks
===========

A centre for publishing open source books about ColdFusion

## Open ftw!
This, in essence, would be a directory of Open Sourced books written about ColdFusion. Features would include:

* Generation of books from source into various formats
* Searching and browsing of books
* Book submission
* Book discussion, rating, etc.
* Book update subscriptions / send to kindle / email / etc.
* ... other stuff...(?)

## Rules for book submission

* Source must be easily publicly accessible
* Contribution to the book must be promoted and easily accessible
* [possible] books must be filtered through a friendly firewall of editors (volunteers required) - *not sure about this*
* Internationalization supported, i.e. people should be able to translate the book and submit translations and corrections to the source repository
* ... etc... (?)

## GitHub encouraged

There's a great example of an open source book managed on GitHub here:

The output:
